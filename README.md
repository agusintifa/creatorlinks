# CreatorLinks

Shark-a-Hack Project.

CreatorLinks is an open source, self-hosted version of Linktr.ee, with additional features to facilitate sharing text content (such as DO tutorials) on platforms like Instagram. This mobile-first application is helpful to aggregate content from different sources, allowing users to reference a single link in social media profiles. It works essentially as a hub of quick links; as an additional feature, we can include a redirection mechanism to automatically redirect to a certain page depending on the origin of the request.
